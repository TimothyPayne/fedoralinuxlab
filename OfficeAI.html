<h1>Using AI for Office and Administrative Support</h1>

<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help with many common office and administrative tasks. The quality of the results depends on how clearly the task is described. Small changes in wording can change tone, format, and usefulness of the response.</p>

<h2>Example 1: Formal vs. Business-Casual Writing</h2>

<p><strong>Question A (Too General):</strong> Write a letter to a parent about a missed meeting.<br>
<strong>Result:</strong> The tone may not match workplace expectations.</p>

<p><strong>Question B (Formal):</strong> Write a formal business letter to a parent explaining that they missed a scheduled meeting and how to reschedule.<br>
<strong>Question C (Business Casual):</strong> Write a polite, business-casual email to a parent explaining they missed a meeting and inviting them to reschedule.<br>
<strong>What Changes:</strong> Specifying tone changes word choice, length, and level of formality.</p>

<h2>Example 2: Giving Context for Accuracy</h2>

<p><strong>Question A:</strong> Draft a memo about office hours.<br>
<strong>Question B:</strong> Draft a short memo for staff announcing new front-office hours, effective March 1.<br>
<strong>What Changes:</strong> Adding details helps the AI produce a clear, usable memo.</p>

<h2>Example 3: Asking for Data or a Chart</h2>

<p><strong>Question A:</strong> Make a chart showing attendance.<br>
<strong>Question B:</strong> Create a simple table showing monthly student attendance percentages for a progress report.<br>
<strong>What Changes:</strong> The AI now knows what kind of data display is needed and how it will be used.</p>

<h2>Example 4: Step-by-Step Help</h2>

<p><strong>Question A:</strong> Help me organize records.<br>
<strong>Question B:</strong> List step-by-step instructions for organizing student records by year and last name.<br>
<strong>What Changes:</strong> Asking for steps turns a general answer into a clear process.</p>

<h2>Example 5: Revising Existing Text</h2>

<p><strong>Question A:</strong> Fix this email.<br>
<strong>Question B:</strong> Rewrite this email to be clearer and more professional while keeping it friendly.<br>
<strong>What Changes:</strong> The AI understands the goal is improvement, not rewriting from scratch.</p>

<h2>Key Tips for Office and Admin Tasks</h2>

<ul>
    <li>State the audience (parent, staff, supervisor)</li>
    <li>Choose the tone (formal, professional, friendly)</li>
    <li>Ask for a format (letter, email, table, steps)</li>
    <li>Review and edit before using</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Privacy Reminder:</strong> Do not include confidential or personal information (such as student records, addresses, or ID numbers) when using AI tools.</p>

<h2>Additional Examples for Office and Administrative Support</h2>

<h2>Example 6: Scheduling and Calendar Management</h2>

<p><strong>Question A:</strong> Help me schedule meetings.<br>
<strong>Question B:</strong> Create a weekly meeting schedule for a school office, avoiding lunch hours and including setup time.<br>
<strong>What Changes:</strong> Adding constraints helps the AI suggest realistic schedules.</p>

<h2>Example 7: Front-Desk Scripts</h2>

<p><strong>Question A:</strong> What should I say when answering the phone?<br>
<strong>Question B:</strong> Write a short, professional phone greeting for a high school front office, including how to place callers on hold.<br>
<strong>What Changes:</strong> The response becomes ready-to-use and appropriate for the setting.</p>

<h2>Example 8: Meeting Agendas and Minutes</h2>

<p><strong>Question A:</strong> Make an agenda for a meeting.<br>
<strong>Question B:</strong> Create a simple agenda for a 30-minute staff meeting with time limits for each topic.<br>
<strong>What Changes:</strong> Time limits and purpose make the agenda practical.</p>

<h2>Example 9: Checklists and Procedures</h2>

<p><strong>Question A:</strong> Help me with onboarding.<br>
<strong>Question B:</strong> Create a checklist for onboarding a new front-office staff member during their first week.<br>
<strong>What Changes:</strong> The AI provides an organized task list instead of general advice.</p>

<h2>Example 10: End-of-Day or End-of-Term Tasks</h2>

<p><strong>Question A:</strong> What should I do at the end of the day?<br>
<strong>Question B:</strong> List end-of-day closeout tasks for a school office, including records, communication, and security.<br>
<strong>What Changes:</strong> Specific context leads to a complete and useful checklist.</p>
