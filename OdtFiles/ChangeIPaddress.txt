✅ Step 1 — List your NetworkManager connections
nmcli connection show


You will see something like:

NAME                UUID                                  TYPE      DEVICE
Wired connection 1  9f3a7bd0-2c4e-4a66-9a9b-9b4d0e6ace21  ethernet  enp3s0


You need the NAME (example: Wired connection 1).

✅ Step 2 — Bring the connection down
sudo nmcli connection down "Wired connection 1"


(Replace with your actual connection name.)

✅ Step 3 — Bring the connection up
sudo nmcli connection up "Wired connection 1"
