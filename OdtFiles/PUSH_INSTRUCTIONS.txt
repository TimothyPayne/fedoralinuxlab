PUSH_INSTRUCTIONS.txt

Purpose
-------
This file contains concise instructions for committing and pushing changes to GitHub using a Personal Access Token (PAT), previewing the static site locally, and tips for deploying to your host by FTP or automating deploys with GitHub Actions or GitHub Pages.

1) Quick local workflow (commit & push)
--------------------------------------
- Make your edits locally in the repo (e.g., `/home/Mothy/LUGpages/index.html`).

- Stage and commit changes:

```bash
cd /home/Mothy/LUGpages
git add index.html
git commit -m "Small edit: update logo placement or text"
```

- Push to GitHub (HTTPS). When prompted for a password, enter a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of your password.

```bash
git push origin main
```

Notes about the PAT:
- Create a PAT at https://github.com/settings/tokens (classic or fine-grained tokens work). Minimum scopes: repo (for repo access). If you only need to push to public repos, repo:public_repo is sufficient.
- Do NOT paste the token into files or share it. Treat it like a password.

2) Avoid entering the PAT every push (optional)
---------------------------------------------
- Use Git credential helper (store once):

```bash
# Store credentials (prompts once and saves in plain text in ~/.git-credentials)
git config --global credential.helper store
# Or cache temporarily (in-memory cache)
git config --global credential.helper cache
```

- Or use your OS credential manager (recommended) or a personal credential manager tool.

3) Preview the site locally (fast)
----------------------------------
- From the repo directory serve the site with Python (simple):

```bash
cd /home/Mothy/LUGpages
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

- Open http://localhost:8000 in a browser. This serves files exactly as static files so you can verify links and images.

4) FTP / FileZilla quick checklist (if you must upload manually)
---------------------------------------------------------------
- In FileZilla, confirm the remote directory where `index.html` is located. Typical docroots:
  - `public_html/`
  - `httpdocs/`
  - `htdocs/`
  - `www/`
- Ensure `images/` is a sibling of `index.html` and contains `UdrConst.jpeg` with exact filename case.
- Right-click the file → File permissions → set to 644 for files and 755 for directories.
- If things look missing, upload `test-xyz.html` next to `index.html`, then browse https://yourdomain/test-xyz.html to confirm you're in the right docroot.

5) Automate deployment (no FTP, no host panel required)
-----------------------------------------------------
A) GitHub Actions → FTP deploy (recommended if host supports FTP)
- Add a workflow that uploads the contents of the repo to your host via FTP when you push.
- Add these repository secrets in GitHub: `FTP_HOST`, `FTP_USERNAME`, `FTP_PASSWORD`, `FTP_REMOTE_DIR` (path to the webroot, e.g., `public_html/`).
- Workflow template (example using an FTP action) — I can add this file to your repo if you want.

B) GitHub Pages (if you can change DNS)
- Go to your repo Settings → Pages and choose `main` branch, root (/) as the source.
- If you want to use `fedoralinuxlab.org` as a custom domain, update your DNS records to point to GitHub Pages and add a `CNAME` file with the domain.
- GitHub Pages automatically publishes on each push.

C) Netlify / Vercel (recommended alternative)
- Connect your GitHub repo to Netlify or Vercel and set the publish directory to the repo root.
- They provide easy custom-domain setup and continuous deploy on push.

6) Troubleshooting checklist
----------------------------
- Case sensitivity: Linux hosting is case-sensitive. Ensure filename in HTML matches exactly.
- Permissions: Files 644, directories 755.
- `.htaccess`: A rewrite rule or deny directive could block `/images/`. If present, download and inspect it.
- CDN / Cache: If you use Cloudflare or similar, purge cache after uploading.
- Confirm remote path: In FileZilla the top path shown is usually the FTP home; the actual webroot may be a subfolder like `public_html/`.

7) If you want me to automate the deploy (I can add files to the repo)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I can create a GitHub Actions workflow that will FTP-upload the site whenever you push to `main`. To set that up I will:
- Create `.github/workflows/ftp-deploy.yml` in the repo.
- Provide exact names for repository secrets to add (e.g., `FTP_HOST`, `FTP_USER`, `FTP_PASS`, `FTP_REMOTE_DIR`).
- Test the workflow instructions here; you will add the secrets through the GitHub UI.

8) Quick commands reference
--------------------------
```bash
# Serve locally
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Stage, commit and push changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update site"
git push origin main

# Use cached credentials (prompt saved for some time)
git config --global credential.helper cache
```

9) Notes and safety
-------------------
- Never commit secrets (PATs, FTP passwords) into the repo. Use GitHub Secrets for Actions.
- If you want me to add the Actions workflow, I'll provide the file and exact secret names; you add secrets in repo Settings → Secrets → Actions.

If you want, I can now add the `PUSH_INSTRUCTIONS.txt` file (this file), plus an FTP deploy workflow. Tell me which: (A) just the instructions file (done), (B) add FTP deploy GitHub Action, or (C) switch to GitHub Pages/Netlify guidance and files.
