<h3 class="section-title">Question for Google AI:</h3>

<p class="body-text">“How well do New Mexico colleges and universities teach problem-solving skills?”</p>
<p class="body-text">(Query: New Mexico's higher education)</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><br/>

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">The system places a
strong emphasis on developing essential skills, including <strong>critical
thinking and problem-solving</strong>, with these skills integrated
into the statewide general education curriculum and individual
university programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0.2in"><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<h3 class="section-title">Instructional Approach and Focus</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Integrated Essential
	Skills</strong>: The New Mexico Higher Education Department's
	General Education Curriculum Model mandates that all public higher
	education institutions focus on essential skills, with &quot;Critical
	Thinking&quot; a core component in all six content areas
	(Communications, Mathematics, Science, Social &amp; Behavioral
	Sciences, Humanities). Problem Setting, Evidence Acquisition,
	Evidence Evaluation, and Reasoning/Conclusion are specific
	components of critical thinking that courses are required to
	address.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Experiential Learning</strong>:
	Universities like the University of New Mexico (UNM) and New Mexico
	State University (NMSU) incorporate &quot;high-impact practices&quot;
	such as undergraduate research, internships, and community
	engagement to provide students with real-world problem-solving
	experiences.</p></li>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Problem-Based Learning
	(PBL)</strong>: Some departments, such as Biochemistry and Molecular
	Biology at UNM, have used online problem-based learning case
	discussions in large classes to actively teach and assess
	problem-solving strategies, allowing faculty to measure improvements
	and identify areas where students struggle.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Foundational Support</strong>: Courses like
	&quot;Foundational Math&quot; at UNM are designed specifically to
	build foundational math, problem-solving, and self-directed learning
	skills, with evidence showing that students who take this course are
	more likely to graduate.&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p></p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="section-title">Outcomes and Employer Perspectives</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><strong>Employer Demand</strong>:
	Employers in New Mexico, consistent with national trends, highly
	value problem-solving and critical thinking skills in new graduates,
	often prioritizing these skills over a specific major or GPA.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Perceived Gaps</strong>: While problem-solving is a
	core part of the curriculum, some studies and employer surveys
	indicate a perception that students could be better prepared in
	complex problem-solving and critical thinking. This suggests that
	while the focus is present, the effective translation into applied
	skills for all students remains an ongoing challenge.&nbsp;</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><p></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="body-text">In summary, New Mexico colleges and universities have a <strong>structured and intentional framework</strong> for teaching problem-solving skills, with a focus on critical thinking and real-world application. The effectiveness, however, appears to vary by program and individual student, as the state actively works to enhance these outcomes across all institutions.</p>
