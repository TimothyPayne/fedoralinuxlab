# Fedora Linux Lab — site

This is a small static HTML site for the Fedora Linux Lab. The repository contains the site HTML and images.

Notes:
- Backup files (`*.bak*`) are intentionally ignored by `.gitignore` to avoid clutter; important backups can be kept separately if desired.
- Use `git` to track changes and restore previous versions instead of relying on many `.bak` files.

Quick start:

```bash
cd /home/Mothy/LUGpages
git init -b main   # already done by the maintainer if you accept
git add .
git commit -m "Initial import"
```

If you want, I can make this repo remote (GitHub/GitLab) and push the commits for offsite backup.
