<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">Problem-solving is
crucial in the workplace because It fosters adaptability, boosts team
performance through collaboration and conflict resolution, and is
essential for career growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><a href="https://www.naceweb.org/talent-acquisition/candidate-selection/what-are-employers-looking-for-when-reviewing-college-students-resumes">https://www.naceweb.org/talent-acquisition/candidate-selection/what-are-employers-looking-for-when-reviewing-college-students-resumes</a></p>

<p>But which attributes and skills are most important to employers? 
</p>
<p>Specifically, when asked what attributes they are looking for on
resumes, nearly 90% of employers responding to <a href="https://www.naceweb.org/research/reports/job-outlook/2025">NACE’s&nbsp;<em>Job
Outlook 2025</em></a> survey indicated they are seeking evidence of a
student’s ability to solve problems and nearly 80% are seeking
candidates who have strong teamwork skills. (See Figure 1.)</p>
<p>Written communication skills, initiative, strong work ethic, and
technical skills are important to at least 70% of responding
employers. 
</p>
<p>In addition, more than two-thirds seek verbal communication
skills, flexibility/adaptability and analytical/quantitative skills
in the candidates they recruit.</p>

<h1 class="western">The State of Critical Thinking 2020</h1>
<h6 class="western">November 2020</h6>
<p>Introduction In 2018, the Reboot Foundation released a
first-of-its-kind survey looking at the public’s attitudes toward
critical thinking and critical thinking education. The report found
that critical thinking skills are highly valued, but not taught or
practiced as much as might be hoped for in schools or in public life.</p>
<p>The survey suggested that, despite recognizing the importance of
critical thinking, when it came to critical thinking practices—like
seeking out multiple sources of information and engaging others with
opposing views—many people’s habits were lacking. Significant
numbers of respondents reported relying on inadequate sources of
information, making decisions without doing enough research, and
avoiding those with conflicting viewpoints.</p>
