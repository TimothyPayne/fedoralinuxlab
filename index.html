<h1 class="title">Welcome to the Fedora Linux Lab</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">A resource for parents of High School children</h2>
<p class="subtitle">All people are welcome and help from Linux Professionals is greatly appreciated</p>
<p class="lead">Caution must be used when using the family computer. Fedora can be used with as little as 4 GB of RAM.</p>

<p class="body-text">The goal of this site is to give parents in Las Cruces, New Mexico a way for their child to develop the number one skill employers want: problem solving — no matter what the job. You can buy a condo for what it costs to go to university. This site is to teach how problems are solved hands-on, something High School currently cannot teach. By using Fedora Linux as the lab and ChatGPT and other AI as resources, students can follow step-by-step guidance, test, and iterate until problems are solved. I was concerned about the progress of robots: a humanoid robot that costs less per year than a human worker at $15/hour is a serious change. Robots may be better, cheaper, and faster, but they lack human imagination for creative problem solving. Learning to work with AI and debug errors is one of the many skills required to solve real problems; this will not be easy, but gaining valuable skills never is.</p>

<h3 class="section-title">What is Linux?</h3>
<p class="body-text">Linux is a free and open-source computer operating system, like Windows only much better and there are big fundamental differences.</p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Fedora allows
you to change the desktop you use not just colors or style, you can
switch to a light weight desktop if you are short on RAM. It may
sound odd, but you don’t need a desktop or a mouse with Linux. The
GUI (graphical user interface) uses a lot of resources to display 3D
buttons and make it look pretty but it is not necessary. A
lightweight desktop is more of a down to basics, needed for older
computers.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">What is Open
Source?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">If you are
using Chrome or Firefox browsers, you can Right-click a blank spot on
a page, in the menu select View Source, and you will see the code it
takes to display what is on the page. If you sell an App or program
that’s your secret sauce and you don’t want to give away what you
sell. Open Source does allow you access to the code so it is ‘Open’. 
Why give it away? There are countless reasons many make a version
available free, and offer extra options for the paid version. This
could include a special version for a company that solves their
problem.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">What is
Fedora?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">The Red Hat
company produces an operating system for servers, and Fedora. The
computer servers are in the back room on a rack working like a big
pumps, you don’t want any problems with your bank account. It must
be very secure and flawless it is your money. This is why our
Department of Defense does over a billion dollars in business with
Red Hat it is the secret stuff for the US. Why do they give away Fedora? It is
designed to serve as a public testing ground and technology incubator
for new features. They could not possibly test every combination of
hardware and software by themselves. </font>
</p>
<p align="left"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">This is a do-it-yourself skills-building approach that can cost little to nothing. AI tools can provide helpful, step-by-step guidance. If you have an older computer, ask ChatGPT for detailed instructions to install a lightweight desktop.</font></p>
