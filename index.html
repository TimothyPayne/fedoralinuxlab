<font size="6" style="font-size: 24pt">Welcome to the Fedora Linux
Lab</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="5" style="font-size: 20pt">A resource
for parents of High School children</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="5" style="font-size: 20pt">All people
are welcome and help from Linux Professionals is greatly appreciated</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="4" style="font-size: 16pt">Caution must
be used when using the family computer and is discouraged. Fedora can
be used with as little as 4 GB of RAM</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">The goal of
this site is to give parents in Las Cruces New Mexico (or around the
world) a way for their child to develop the number 1 skill employers
want ‘Problem Solving’ no matter what the job. This is to ‘Learn
How’ problems are solved hands on, that High School can not teach
currently. By using Fedora Linux as the Lab with ChatGPT and other AI
as the textbook with the answers. I was alarmed at the progress of
robots and that Tesla’s Humanoid Robot costs less than a year for a
Human at $15 per hour. Even worse the robot will last a few years
making them far less cost than a Human. A low cost box with 2 arms
and a camera with an AI wireless connection will make things even more
difficult. As I looked further into AI finding that it will make
things difficult in New Mexico in the near future. A robot may be
better, cheaper, faster, but it does not have our Human imagination
to solve problems. Using AI to ask a question, use the answer, take
the error message if it did not work and form another detailed
question, in a loop until the problem is solved. Just one of the many
skills it takes to solve problems step by step. This will not be
easy, gaining valuable skills never is.</font></p>

is Linux?</font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Linux is a
free and open-source computer operating system, like Windows only
much better and there are big fundamental differences.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Fedora allows
you to change the desktop you use not just colors or style, you can
switch to a light weight desktop if you are short on RAM. It may
sound odd, but you don’t need a desktop or a mouse with Linux. The
GUI (graphical user interface) uses a lot of resources to display 3D
buttons and make it look pretty but it is not necessary. A
lightweight desktop is more of a down to basics, needed for older
computers.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">What is Open
Source?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">If you are
using Chrome or Firefox browsers, you can Right-click a blank spot on
a page, in the menu select View Source, and you will see the code it
takes to display what is on the page. If you sell an App or program
that’s your secret sauce and you don’t want to give away what you
sell. Open Source does allow you access to the code so it is ‘Open’. 
Why give it away? There are countless reasons many make a version
available free, and offer extra options for the paid version. This
could include a special version for a company that solves their
problem.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">What is
Fedora?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">The Red Hat
company produces an operating system for servers, and Fedora. The
computer servers are in the back room on a rack working like a big
pumps, you don’t want any problems with your bank account. It must
be very secure and flawless it is your money. This is why our
Department of Defense does over a billion dollars in business with
Red Hat it is the secret stuff for the US. Why do they give away Fedora? It is
designed to serve as a public testing ground and technology incubator
for new features. They could not possibly test every combination of
hardware and software by themselves. </font>
