<h1 class="title">Welcome to the Fedora Linux Lab</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">A resource for parents of High School children</h2>
<p class="subtitle">All people are welcome and help from Linux Professionals is greatly appreciated</p>
<p class="lead">Caution must be used when using the family computer. Fedora can be used with as little as 4 GB of RAM.</p>

<p class="body-text">The goal of this site is to give parents in Las Cruces, New Mexico a way for their child to develop the number one skill employers want:</p> <p>Problem Solving — No matter what the job. </p>
<p>What is Linux?</p>
<p>Linux is a free and open-source computer operating system, like Windows only much better and there are big fundamental differences. Fedora allows you to change the desktop you see not just colors, you can switch to a different lightweight desktop for older computers short on RAM.</p>

<p>What is Open Source?</p>
<p>Open Source allows you access to the source code (programming) so it is ‘Open’. Why give it away? There are countless reasons many make a version available free, and offer extra options for the paid version.</p>

<p>What is Fedora?</p>
<p>Red Hat (DoD spends a Billion+ with them) produces Fedora which is designed to serve as a public testing ground and technology incubator for new features.</p>
