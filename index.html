<p>The Linux Operating System is very difficult to learn initially but offers great rewards for the challenge.</p>

<p><strong>What is Linux?</strong></p>
<p>Linux is a free and open-source computer operating system, like Windows only much better and there are big fundamental differences. Fedora allows you to change the desktop you see not just colors, you can switch to a different lightweight desktop for older computers short on RAM.</p>

<p><strong>What is Open Source?</strong></p>
<p>Open Source allows you access to the source code (programming) so it is 'Open'. Why give it away? There are countless reasons many make a version available free, and offer extra options for the paid version.</p>

<p><strong>What is Fedora?</strong></p>
<p>Red Hat (DoD spends a Billion+ with them) produces Fedora which is designed to serve as a public testing ground and technology incubator for new features.</p>


<p class="body-text">This is an intense do-it-yourself skills-building approach that can cost little to nothing. AI tools can provide helpful, step-by-step guidance. You really should use a dedicated computer for this, it can be an older machine I am using Xfce desktop. You will make mistakes and that is how you learn, that makes it risky for the family computer. Booting from a USB drive and looking around Fedora is safe if you are careful, the Media Writer will do the download for you and write to the USB. A ChatGPT account is highly recommended.</p>

<p class="lead">Caution must be used when using the family computer. Fedora can be used with as little as 4 GB of RAM.</p>
