<h4>What to Notice</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Which version would help you write YOUR report in YOUR words?</li>
    <li>Which gave you too much information?</li>
    <li>Which was just right?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Your Turn</h4>

<p>Think of a homework topic and write 3 different questions about it!</p>

<hr>

<h2>Mission 4: The Format Experiment</h2>

<h3>Goal</h3>

<p>Learn how to ask AI to give answers in different formats.</p>

<p><strong>Let's learn about planets...</strong></p>

<h4>Step 1: Regular answer</h4>

<pre><code>Tell me about the planets in our solar system.</code></pre>

<h4>Step 2: List format</h4>

<pre><code>List the planets in our solar system from closest to farthest from the sun.</code></pre>

<h4>Step 3: Table format</h4>

<pre><code>Create a simple table showing each planet's name, size (small/medium/large), and one cool fact about it.</code></pre>

<h4>Step 4: Fun format</h4>

<pre><code>Describe each planet in our solar system as if they were characters in a story, using one sentence per planet.</code></pre>

<h4>What to Notice</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Which format was easiest to read?</li>
    <li>Which would be best for studying?</li>
    <li>Which was the most fun?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Your Turn</h4>

<p>Pick a topic and ask for it in 3 different formats: list, paragraph, and table!</p>

<hr>

<h2>Mission 5: The Polite vs. Direct Test</h2>

<h3>Goal</h3>

<p>Learn about being specific vs. polite (spoiler: both work, but specific is better!).</p>

<h4>Step 1: Very polite but vague</h4>

<pre><code>Could you maybe help me think of some ideas for things to draw?</code></pre>

<h4>Step 2: Direct and specific</h4>

<pre><code>Give me 5 drawing ideas for animals doing funny things.</code></pre>

<h4>Step 3: Super specific with details</h4>

<pre><code>Give me 5 drawing ideas featuring animals doing unexpected activities (like a giraffe playing basketball). Include different types of animals.</code></pre>

<h4>What to Notice</h4>

<ul>
    <li>You can be polite OR direct - both are fine!</li>

<h4>Step 2: Make it more specific</h4>

<pre><code>That sounds interesting! Can you make it easier and use materials I can find in the kitchen?</code></pre>

<h4>Step 3: Ask for details</h4>

<pre><code>Can you give me step-by-step instructions for that experiment?</code></pre>

<h4>Step 4: Ask for the "why"</h4>

<pre><code>Why does this experiment work? Explain it simply.</code></pre>

<h4>What to Notice</h4>

<ul>
    <li>You don't have to get it perfect the first time!</li>
    <li>You can keep asking to make answers better</li>
    <li>Follow-up questions are super helpful</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your AI Question Checklist</h2>

<p>Before asking AI a question, ask yourself:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>What exactly do I want?</strong> (a story, facts, a list, an explanation?)</li>
    <li><strong>Who am I?</strong> (Should AI know I'm 10 years old?)</li>
    <li><strong>How detailed?</strong> (One sentence? A paragraph? A whole page?)</li>
    <li><strong>What format?</strong> (List, table, story, step-by-step?)</li>
    <li><strong>Any examples?</strong> (Can I show AI what kind of thing I want?)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Creative Practice Ideas</h2>

<h3>Week 1: Story Time</h3>

<p>Each day, ask AI for a different type of story by changing ONE thing:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Different character (robot, dinosaur, astronaut)</li>
    <li>Different setting (space, underwater, jungle)</li>
    <li>Different mood (funny, mysterious, exciting)</li>
    <li>Different length (1 paragraph, 3 paragraphs)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 2: Learning Helper</h3>

<p>Practice asking about school subjects in different ways:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Explain like I'm 10</li>
    <li>Give me examples</li>
    <li>Make it a game</li>
    <li>Use analogies (comparing to things I know)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Week 3: Creative Projects</h3>

<p>Ask AI to help with creative projects:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Ideas for drawings</li>
    <li>Story starters</li>
    <li>Game ideas</li>
    <li>Science experiments</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Remember: AI is a helper, not a homework-doer! Always use AI to learn and understand, then write answers in YOUR own words.</strong></p>

<hr>

<h2>Important Rules for Using AI</h2>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Never share personal information</strong> (your address, phone number, school name, etc.)</li>
    <li><strong>Always check facts</strong> with a trusted adult or another source</li>
    <li><strong>Use AI to help you learn</strong>, not to do your work for you</li>
    <li><strong>Be creative and experiment</strong> - you can't break AI by asking questions!</li>
    <li><strong>Ask a parent or teacher</strong> if you're not sure about something</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>Track Your Progress</h2>

<p>Create a journal where you write:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The question you asked</li>
    <li>What answer you got</li>
    <li>How you changed the question</li>
    <li>What worked better</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>What You've Learned</h2>

<p>By completing this project, you now know:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Specific questions get better answers</li>
    <li>You can ask AI to explain things at your level</li>
    <li>Details and examples help AI understand what you want</li>
    <li>You can ask follow-up questions to improve answers</li>
    <li>Different formats work for different purposes</li>
    <li>AI is a tool to help you learn and create</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>Keep Exploring!</h2>

<p>Now that you know how to talk to AI, keep practicing! The more you use it, the better you'll get at asking great questions.</p>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> The best questions are clear, specific, and include the details that matter!</p>

<p>Happy AI exploring!</p>
