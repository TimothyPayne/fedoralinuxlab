breakdown of wage-earning taxpayers by group and the percentage of
total federal income tax they contribute varies based on factors such
as income level, tax brackets, and overall distribution of wealth.
The U.S. tax system is progressive, meaning that higher earners pay a
larger percentage of their income in taxes. However, the contribution
of each group (by income level) to the overall tax system is not
evenly distributed. Here's a rough overview:</p>
<h3 class="western">1. <strong>Top 1% of Earners</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Income Threshold:</strong> Roughly those earning over
	<strong>$540,000</strong> annually (as of recent years).</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Percentage of Total Income Tax Paid:</strong> This
	group pays a <strong>large portion</strong> of the total federal
	income tax, often reported to contribute about <strong>40%</strong>
	to <strong>45%</strong> of all federal income taxes collected.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Effective Tax Rate:</strong> This group typically
	faces an average effective tax rate around <strong>30% to 35%</strong>
	(combined federal income taxes and other taxes).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="western">2. <strong>Top 5% of Earners</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Income Threshold:</strong> Around <strong>$250,000</strong>
	to <strong>$540,000</strong>.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Percentage of Total Income Tax Paid:</strong> The top
	5% typically contributes about <strong>55%</strong> of federal
	income taxes.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Effective Tax Rate:</strong> This group generally has
	an average effective tax rate around <strong>25%</strong> to <strong>30%</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="western">3. <strong>Top 10% of Earners</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Income Threshold:</strong> About <strong>$160,000</strong>
	and up.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Percentage of Total Income Tax Paid:</strong> The top
	10% contributes roughly <strong>70%</strong> to <strong>75%</strong>
	of the total federal income taxes.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Effective Tax Rate:</strong> The effective tax rate
	for this group ranges from <strong>20%</strong> to <strong>25%</strong>,
	depending on specific income and deductions.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="western">4. <strong>Middle 40% of Earners</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Income Range:</strong> Generally, people earning
	between <strong>$45,000</strong> and <strong>$160,000</strong>.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Percentage of Total Income Tax Paid:</strong> The
	middle 40% of earners pay around <strong>20%</strong> to <strong>25%</strong>
	of total federal income taxes.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Effective Tax Rate:</strong> These individuals
	typically face a <strong>15% to 20%</strong> effective tax rate.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="western">5. <strong>Bottom 50% of Earners</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Income Range:</strong> People earning under <strong>$45,000</strong>
	annually.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Percentage of Total Income Tax Paid:</strong> This
	group contributes <strong>around 5%</strong> to <strong>10%</strong>
	of federal income taxes. Although they may pay payroll taxes (Social
	Security and Medicare), their federal income tax burden is
	significantly lower, and some may even receive refunds through
	credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Effective Tax Rate:</strong> For this group, the
	effective tax rate is generally <strong>10% or lower</strong> or
	even <strong>negative</strong> due to credits and deductions that
	offset their tax liability.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 class="western">Summary of Tax Contribution by Income Group:</h3>
<ul>
	<li><p><strong>Top 1%</strong>: ~40-45% of federal taxes.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Top 5%</strong>: ~55% of federal taxes.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Top 10%</strong>: ~70-75% of federal taxes.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Middle 40%</strong>: ~20-25% of federal taxes.</p></li>
	<li><p><strong>Bottom 50%</strong>: ~5-10% of federal taxes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These figures reflect federal income tax contributions and do not
account for state or local taxes, which can vary widely by region.
Additionally, payroll taxes (Social Security and Medicare) are
somewhat regressive, meaning they take a higher percentage of income
from lower earners, but these aren't included in the breakdown above.</p>
